        <h2 class="believe">What We Believe</h2>
        <p class="frist-text">
          WE BELIEVE in one God, who exists in three Persons — the Father, the
          Son and the Holy Spirit. He is good, loving, righteous, holy and
          just.<br />
          WE BELIEVE that the Bible is God’s Word. It is inspired by the Holy
          Spirit and accurate. It is our perfect guide and final authority in
          all matters of life.<br />
          WE BELIEVE that sin has separated us all (mankind) from God, and that
          only through Jesus Christ can we (mankind) be reconciled to God.<br />
          WE BELIEVE that Jesus Christ is both God and Man. He was conceived by
          the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived a sinless life,
          took all our sins upon Himself, died and rose again. Today, He is
          seated at the right hand of the Father as our High Priest and
          Mediator.<br />
          WE BELIEVE that salvation is the gift of God to man. This gift is
          received by grace through faith in Jesus Christ.<br />
          WE BELIEVE that water baptism is a symbol of the cleansing power of
          God and a testimony of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
          WE BELIEVE that the Holy Spirit is our Comforter. He guides us in all
          areas of our lives. He also blesses us with spiritual gifts and
          empowers us to yield the fruit of the Spirit and live a life pleasing
          unto God.<br />
          WE BELIEVE that the Holy Communion is a celebration of Jesus’ death
          and our remembrance of Him.<br />
          WE BELIEVE that God wants to transform, heal and prosper us, so that
          we can live blessed and victorious lives that will impact and help
          others. WE BELIEVE that we are called to preach the gospel to all
          nations.<br />
          WE BELIEVE that our Lord Jesus Christ is coming back again just as He
          promised.
